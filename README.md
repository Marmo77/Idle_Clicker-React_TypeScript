# TypeScriptClicker

**TypeScriptClicker** is a simple clicker game built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwindcss** and **Vite**. This project serves as a practical introduction to building interactive web apps using modern frontend technologies. This game has basic skill set of *Typescript* and *React* functions. It was mainly made for learning and getting used to React and typescript *rules*, but also getting used to Git and GitHub as the main file/project storage. (I used to do it locally in folders on my computer lol, and most of it disappeared into the depths of my computer somewhere)

## About the Project

This project demonstrates a minimal setup for a React + TypeScript application using Vite as the build tool. 
It's made in React and TypeScript elements. Using *useState* for variables like Coins, Click power, etc; 
*localStorage* for a saving data without using databases. *useEffect* for updating data on change of variable.
It also use "react-hot-toast" for notifications in *Code Reedem* so its more User Friendly then alerts.
